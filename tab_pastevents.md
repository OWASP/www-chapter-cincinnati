‘what’ to do, but not the ‘why’. When we are told to ensure there are no false
positives in the pipeline, the reason seems obvious, but not every part of
DevOps is that intuitive, and not all ‘best practices’ make sense on first
blush. Let’s explore tried, tested, and failed methods, and then flip them on
their head, so we know not only what to do to avoid them, but also why it is
important to do so, with these DevSecOps WORST practices.

## January 2024 Meeting

### Stand Up Straight - Security Posture And You

**Discussion Abstract:** Someone likely told you to stand up or sit up straight
at some point in your childhood. We buy ergonomic chairs and desks to help us
maintain a healthy posture while we work. We have been told forever that good
posture has benefits for our joint and muscle health. We instinctively
understand how to straighten our stances and spines. But, a new kind of posture
has recently emerged that is not as intuitive: security posture.

Without understanding what good security posture is and how we can measure it,
being told to improve it is about as helpful as being told to "get better at
security." While there is no 100% right one-size-fits-all way to approach
security, mapping your goals against your current tools and processes is going
to give you a much better view of how you can improve your security stance.

This session is an attempt to both define and give a roadmap to measure security
posture, no matter how large or complex the organization is or where you are on
the security journey.

Takeaways:

- Defining Security Posture
- How to measure your posture
- The emergence of contextual security and security posture management platforms
- Basing your stance on threat mapping
- Establishing an active defensive stance

## June 2022 Meeting

### Conjur Secrets Management

**Discussion Abstract:** The process of making our code more secure has many components, but how we secure the keys to our kingdom is probably the area with the most to lose. After all, if an attacker has your database credentials, you're toast. Yet many developers don't have a comprehensive system for managing such sensitive information.  Do your software developers have access to the production database? If an employee quits, could they take their credentials with them, or could you easily revoke access without affecting the other developers or production deployments? Can you easily audit access to your secrets and see which applications are using them? Can you easily rotate secrets that are used in containerized deployments in multiple different clouds?  In this talk we'll demonstrate how to solve all of these problems with Conjur, an open source secrets management application.

**Speaker Biography:** Hi! My name is Shlomo Heigh and I'm a senior software engineer at CyberArk.

<b>Agenda:</b>

  - Speaker Introduction, Topic Overview, and OWASP Relevancy
  - Presentation - "Where Does It Hurt? - The Anatomy of a Data Breach"
    by Zach Briggs
  - Roundtable Discussion Opportunity
  - Housekeeping and Meeting Closure

<b>Discussion Abstract:</b> Awareness is not understanding. In the age
of Google and WebMD, people are aware of a lot, but they don’t
understand nearly as much. Case in point - all that causes sickness is
not cancer, not all who lose data have had a breach.
My goal in this presentation is to challenge your understanding of what
makes up a data breach by explaining its full anatomy so that you can
diagnose where it hurts and how to fix it or if you are even sick at
all. All while sharing some of life’s best medicine (laughter) along the
way.

<b>Biography:</b>

Zach Briggs is Corporate Compliance Counsel at Paycor, a human capital
management SaaS company based in Cincinnati. He has a management degree
from Purdue University and his Juris Doctor from Northern Kentucky

Who: Bill Young - Cincinnati Childrens Hospital

Bio: Bill Young is Senior Security Analyst at Cincinnati Children’s
Hospital.  He’s held various roles over the course of his 15-year IT
career including desktop support technician, system administrator,
virtual desktop administrator and web application developer.   He
currently works in security, building an application security program
and doing web application penetration testing. Outside of work he is
married and has 5 children.  He’s a proud member of the Knights of
Columbus catholic charity organization and a big sports fan.

Abstract: Industry report, such as the Verizon Data Breach Investigation
Report, consistently rank web applications one of the top attack
patterns that result in data breaches.  This is increasingly reinforced
as web application breaches from Yahoo, Equifax, Facebook and Google+
have all made the main stream media over the last two years.

The de facto security controls of the past decade (IPS/IDS, network
firewalls, web application firewalls) offer limited mitigation for
on-premise applications and even less for cloud-based applications.  To
properly protect applications, the responsibility for securing them must
be shared amongst the security, development and operations teams and
security must be integrated in all phases of the development lifecycle.

In this talk, I will share our experience creating and expanding an
application security program that aims to do just that.  I will share
the approaches we took (good, bad and ugly) to creating our long-term
vision and goals, measuring our progress, engaging the development,
operations and management teams, and creating security testing
processes.

    highlighted examples of threats in the new M10 category. In my talk,
    I discuss the new category in much more depth. I educate the
    audience about the prevalence of binary risks in both iPhone and
    Android mobile apps. I highlight mobile app risks that relate to
    this new category and how to leverage particular OWASP Projects for
    the solution. By the end of this talk, you will have a solid
    understanding of binary risk and how to begin thinking about
    solutions to this category.

### Is There An End to Testing Ourselves Secure?

  - <b>Who: </b> Rohit Sethi, Vice President, Product Development, [SD
    Elements](http://www.sdelements.com/)

<!-- end list -->

  - <b>Abstract:</b>

<!-- end list -->

  -
    Despite years of research on best practices to integrate security
    into the early phases of the SDLC, most organizations rely on static
    analysis, dynamic analysis, and penetration testing as their primary
    means of eliminating vulnerabilities. This approach leads to
    vulnerabilities discovered late in the development process, thereby
    either cause project delays or risk acceptance. Neither option is
    particularly appealing.

<!-- end list -->

  -
    This talk is a an open discussion with the local chapter about if
    there are scalable, measurable approaches that actually work in the
    real world to address security early into the SDLC, with
    consideration for how agile development impacts effectiveness.
    Points of discussion include:
      - Is static analysis sufficient?
      - Developer awareness training
      - Threat modeling / architecture analysis
      - Secure requirements
      - Considerations for procured applications

### The Danger of the Security ASS-umption

  - <b>Who: </b> Michael Farnum, Security Advocate for
    [Accuvant](http://www.accuvant.com/)

<!-- end list -->

  - <b>Abstract:</b> Many enterprise technical security assessments look
    at too few attack vectors or do not dig far enough into the attack
    vectors once a vulnerability has been discovered. This is often due
    to risk ASS-umptions that are made by security staff / management,
    and these ASS-umptions often cause failures in findings. Come join a
    discussion on the breakdown of a technical security assessment,
    explore the essential attack vectors, and debate the depth to which
    the assessment should go.

### Managing Risk with Threat Modeling

  - <b>Who: </b> Anurag Agarwal, MyAppSecurity Founder

<!-- end list -->

  - <b>Abstract:</b> Threats & vulnerabilities exploits are gaining
    momentum at many companies today because of the recent hacks at
    Sony, PBS, CIA and other high profile companies. Since these
    companies have already adopted mature vulnerability assessment and
    secure code analysis processes/tools and yet, there were negatively
    impacted by these hacks, proves the point that it's not enough to
    rely solely upon traditional application security assessments &
    tools to mitigate the risk and the impact of these hacks. The new
    approach is to use a threat modeling tool and a process to identify
    vulnerabilities during design and use Vulnerability Assessment (VA)
    and/or Static Code Analysis (SCA) tools to validate that these
    threats and vulnerabilties are mitigated in the application and/or
    source code. More and more organizations have realized today, that
    identifying threats during the design phase and planning a technical
    risk mitigation strategy earlier in the SDLC helps in controlling of
    risks as well in the saving time and money. Threat Modeling can
    guide application development teams in ensuring that the
    organization's security policies are followed at time of design
    prior to the development and testing of the application. By creating
    pre-approved security requirements and by applying them with a
    repeatable and scalable process, you can assist your organization
    development teams in building a secure application easily and
    effortless.

### Magic Numbers - Proving Success Through 5 Powerful KPIs

  - <b>Who: </b> Rafal Los, Application Security Evangelist at HP

<!-- end list -->

  - <b>Abstract:</b> By now, most enterprises have figured out the dire
    need for software security assurance (SSA) programs, and are working
    on improving the security of their applications. The problems these
    organizations face now is that these initiatives are most often
    security-team-driven and either fear-based or run on "black magic".
    As organizations mature and start to examine budgets and program
    spending more carefully - these SSA programs are having a difficult
    time explaining what they do, and how (if at all) they're succeeding
    in lowering the risk posture of their parent organization. This talk
    defines Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) which will help bridge the
    gaps between the business and the technical security team that
    supports it. The KPIs presented will provide business context and
    assist in having a more intelligent conversation with the rest of
    the technology organization when it comes to answering the question
    "Is the \[SSA\] program working?".

### Top Website Vulnerabilities: Trends, Business Effects and How to Fight Them

  - <b>Who: </b> Jeremiah Grossman, Founder & CTO of WhiteHat Security

<!-- end list -->

  - <b>Abstract:</b> Jeremiah Grossman, Founder & CTO of WhiteHat
    Security, will draw from their most recent Website Security
    Statistics Report - A statistical picture from over five years of
    continuous vulnerability assessment results taken from over 3,000
    websites across 400 organizations. This represents the largest, most
    complete, and unique dataset of its kind. The presentation will be
    purely metrics focused, specifically discussing which classes of
    vulnerabilities are the most prevalent, measured remediation rates,
    time-to-fix analysis, and sorted by industry and organization size.
    While already incredibly revealing, the discussion will also go
    further back into the SDLC to better understand how many and how
    often vulnerabilities are introduced. For some organizations the
    problem area may simply be the volume of vulnerabilities introduced.
    For other organizations the primary challenge is obtaining the
    resources to fix the vulnerabilities that are identified. For
    others, the greatest need is to accelerate the vulnerability
    resolution process. This is the level of detail organizations need
    to measurably improve their application security programs.

### Cloud Computing Security

  - <b>Who: </b> Dr. James Walden, Assistant Professor Department of
    Computer Science at Northern Kentucky University

<!-- end list -->

  - <b>Abstract:</b> Cloud computing is an emerging paradigm for large
    scale web application deployment. While cloud computing may reduce
    the complexity and costs of web application deployment, it also
    introduces new risks and requires a fundamentally different approach
    to security. Traditional security approaches such as firewalls and
    network intrusion detection are either impossible or inappropriate
    for cloud applications. New risks include loss of governance,
    failure of compliance with regulations that assume infrastructure is
    physical rather than virtual, an expanded attack surface resulting
    from the connection between your organization and the cloud, and
    hypervisor attacks that may enable attackers on the same physical
    server to access your data. This talk will address how these risks
    occur in the context of cloud computing and will examine ways to
    mitigate them.

### How to Prevent Business Flaws Vulnerabilities In Web Applications

  - <b>Who: </b> Marco Morana, OWASP Cincinnati Chapter Lead
    [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org)
    [Bio](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Marco_Morana)

<!-- end list -->

  - <b>Abstract:</b> Business logic attacks (BLA) represent a growing
    threat for web applications. BLA specifically target the business
    logic of the application to exploit vulnerabilities that are
    uncommon and specific to the application logic. Example of these
    vulnerabilities include a flaw in the shopping cart of the
    application that allows a malicious user to alter the price of an
    item and access to unauthorized business transactions through
    forceful browsing to a web page bypassing the normal workflow of the
    application. Scope of the presentation is to analyze the threat
    posed by BLA and provide example on how a threat modeling
    methodology can be used to identify application specific application
    flaws and devise countermeasures so that these attacks can be both
    prevented and detected.

    According to the Gartner hype curve, Web 2.0 technologies have
    reached a stage of mainstream adoption by businesses, therefore is
    critical for information and application security to understand the
    security implications of the adoption of Web 2.0 technologies. Web
    2.0 not only amplify traditional Web 1.0 vulnerabilities such as
    XSS, CSRF and data injection vulnerabilities but also introduces new
    threats: this is due to the intrinsic functionality that Web 2.0
    technology is designed to provide. For example, Web 2.0 technologies
    provide a richer client and user experience than Web 1.0, foster
    user’s collaboration to the sites through user's provided content
    and brings customers closer to businesses through participation to
    social networking sites. The first step is to perform a
    vulnerability and threat analysis of Web 2.0 applications. From
    vulnerability and threat analysis perspective, Web 2.0 application
    vulnerabilities can be analyzed using both OWASP Top 10 and WASC Top
    50 threats categorizations. Critical to the vulnerability analysis
    of Web 2.0 applications is the determination of the vulnerability
    root causes. Only through the identification of the vulnerabilities
    root causes vulnerabilities can be eradicated. The second step is
    build secure Web 2.0 applications. Secure design and implementation
    of Web 2.0 applications starts with a plan for adoption of software
    security activities as part of the SDLC. Essential software security
    activities include the documentation of secure coding requirements
    for Web 2.0 such as for AJAX, secure design and review of Web 2.0
    architectures, manual/automatic secure code reviews/analysis and
    security testing. Security testing need to target both Web 2.0
    client/desktop components (e.g. FLASH, RIA, mashups) as well as
    server components/functionality (e.g. Web services). Finally, the
    third step includes managing the business risks that Web 2.0 design
    flaws and bugs might pose to the business. The OWASP risk
    methodology and a web 2.0 risk framework is proposed as methodology
    to analyze and manage Web 2.0 security risks. A simple example on
    how to integrate with Web 2.0 technology securely such as a twitter
    interface to a web site, it is also presented.

    Popular open source web applications have evolved into complex
    software ecosystems, consisting of a core maintained by a set of
    long term developers and a range of plugins developed by third
    parties. These plugins accomplish such tasks as adding forms to a
    content management system, connecting a blog with social networking
    systems, or even scanning for malware infecting the application. The
    security of such web applications depends as much on vulnerabilities
    found in plugins as it does in vulnerabilities in the application
    core. In this talk, we will examine the security of plugins and the
    impact of adding plugins to the security of those applications. We
    will look at empirical data, such as the number, types, and
    locations of vulnerabilities in these web applications, and examine
    how we can use such data to decide which applications to use and to
    decide how to focus our efforts security such applications.

    With the increasing practice of outsourcing and using 3rd party
    libraries, it is nearly impossible for an enterprise to identify the
    pedigree and security of the software running its business critical
    applications. As a result backdoors and malicious code are
    increasingly becoming the prevalent attack vector used by hackers.
    Whether you manage internal development activities, work with third
    party developers or are developing a COTS application for
    enterprise, your mandate is clear- safeguard your code and make
    applications security a priority for internal and external
    development teams. In this session we will cover; (1) Prevalence of
    backdoors and malicious code in third party attacks; (2) Definitions
    and classifications of backdoors and their impact on your
    applications; (3) Methods to identify, track and remediate these
    vulnerabilities

    Forcing muscle growth is a long process which requires high
    intensity weight training and high mental concentration. While the
    ultimate goal is often clear, one of the greatest mistakes
    bodybuilders consistently make is to overlook the importance of
    tracking their weight lifting progress. Like a successful
    bodybuilding workout, a security development lifecycle program must
    consistently log simple to obtain, yet meaningful metrics throughout
    the entire process. Good metrics must lack subjectivity and clearly
    aid decision makers to determine areas that need improvement. In
    this pragmatic presentation we’ll discuss metrics used at Symantec,
    the world’s largest security ISV, to classify and appropriately
    compare security vulnerabilities found in different phases of the
    SDL by different teams working in different locations and in
    different products. We’ll also discuss how to easily provide
    decision makers different views of the same data and verify whether
    the process is indeed catching critical vulnerabilities internally
    and how the numbers compare with the competition

    Applications are becoming richer in terms of their user interface,
    attempting to leave a lasting impression on the users and wanting
    them to come back for more. Applications these days expose various
    ways for the user to interact with the application to create a
    “rich” application experience for the user. Thick client
    applications are the preferred choice to guarantee the above
    principles since they can leverage existing robust frameworks such
    as JAVA and .NET to create a rich user interface and are not limited
    by the browsers’ (in)ability to render the user interface elements.
    However with the increased sophistication, comes increased
    complexity and hence it is not uncommon to find client applications
    that are not only serving as the “presentation” tier but also
    potentially comprise of business logic to a varied extent. Security
    testing for thick client applications is a fairly involved and
    specialized task as compared to security testing web applications
    since each thick client is custom designed and developed for the
    application at hand. As such security testing each thick client
    application potentially involves dealing with different technologies
    and communication protocols and hence necessitates the use of
    different approaches. Attendees will learn the different strategies
    and methods that can be used for successfully testing thick client
    applications. We will discuss the different techniques to be able to
    bypass client side checks including methods for successfully
    understanding and intercepting client – server network
    communication. We will also evaluate the above mentioned techniques
    at depth in terms of their advantages, disadvantage and when to use
    the particular technique. This talk is intended for application
    testers, developers, project managers and application security
    professionals.

  - <b>Virtual Patching for Web Applications: Theory and Practice</b>
    Ryan Barnett, Director of Application Security Research, Breach
    Security Inc

<!-- end list -->

  -
    Fixing identified vulnerabilities in web application always requires
    time. Organizations often do not have access to a commercial
    application's source code and are at the vendor's mercy while
    waiting for a patch. Even if they have access to the code,
    implementing a patch in development takes time. This leaves a window
    of opportunity for the attacker to exploit. External patching (also
    called "just-in-time patching" and "virtual patching") is one of the
    biggest advantages of web application firewalls as they can fix this
    problem externally. A fix for a specific vulnerability is usually
    very easy to design and in most cases it can be done in less than 15
    minutes. This presentation will outline exactly when and where
    Virtual Patching is appropriate and will show the proper steps for
    their creation and testing.

## October Meeting

  - <b> Threat analysis as methodology for deriving risk-based security
    tests of web application software</b> Marco Morana OWASP Chapter
    Lead (presented at [2009 IMI Security Symposium &
    Expo](http://imi.nku.edu/security/2009_Symposium/default.aspx))

<!-- end list -->

  -
    <b>The presentationcan be downloaded [from
    here](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:IMI_2009_Security_Summit.ppt)
    </b>
    The risk that a web application might incur in a security incident
    such a major data breach depends on several risk factors such as the
    exposure into the public internet, the likelihood of being a target
    as well as the knowledge, tools and techniques available to the
    attacker to break into the application. In order to mitigate such
    risks, web applications are security tested with testing techniques
    such as penetration testing and secure code analysis. The aim of
    this presentation is first to introduce the audience to the basics
    of security testing such as the derivation of functional and non
    functional security requirements, the execution of security testing
    as part of the SDLC and as part of developers and tester workflows.
    The presentation will also cover the most used security testing
    techniques, OWASP testing guide, tools and vulnerability reporting
    and testing metrics. Often companies use security tests for meeting
    compliance requirements such as PCI-DSS, passing such security tests
    provides a level of application security assurance but in light of
    several data breaches occurring to organizations today it is logical
    to ask whether we can consider an application secure because
    security testing did not found any high and medium risk
    vulnerabilities. From the perspective of security testing, this
    status quo advocates the need to a new approach toward security
    testing: a risk based, threat driven approach. From the risk
    mitigation perspective, security tests need to validate mitigations
    against new attack techniques used by cybercriminals and fraudsters
    and focus on tests where the difficulty of the attack is the least
    and the impact is the highest. The presentation will provide
    examples of derivation of risk based security test cases using data
    from cyber-intelligence reports, attack tree analysis, attack vector
    analysis, security flaw analysis, use and misuse cases and
    application threat modeling/secure architecture analysis.

## September Meeting

  - <b>The rise of threat analysis and the fall of compliance in
    mitigating cybercrime risks</b> Marco Morana OWASP Chapter Lead
    (also presented to [OWASP

    On August 5 of 2009, Federal prosecutors charged [Albert
    Gonzales](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Gonzalez) with the
    largest case of credit and debit card data theft ever occurred in
    the United States: the theft of 130 million credit cards numbers by
    hacking into [Heartland Payment
    Systems](http://datalossdb.org/incidents/1518-malicious-software-hack-compromises-unknown-number-of-credit-cards-at-fifth-largest-credit-card-processor),
    [Hannaford
    Brothers](http://datalossdb.org/incidents/932-4-2-million-credit-card-and-debit-card-numbers-exposed-in-breach),
    7-Eleven and two unnamed national retailers. This massive theft of
    credit card data happened despite Heartland Payment Systems and
    Hannaford Bros companies passed security audits in compliance with
    [PCI-DSS standard](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/). This
    fact, let to question the effectiveness of regulatory compliance
    frameworks, and specifically compliance with PCI-DSS standards in
    reducing the likelihood of data breaches, identity theft, and the
    credit card fraud. This presentation will further analyze the impact
    of these data breaches by monetizing the losses as being reported in
    quarterly earnings reports (e.g.
    [TJX](http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2007/02/tjx_date.html))
    as well as impact on stock price (e.g. HPY) at the time of public
    disclosure of the incident. It is shown as monetizing the loss due
    to data breaches helps to frame non-compliance risks as a factor of
    business impact to mitigate non compliance fines. Traditional
    compliance and audit driven security assessments efforts are
    compared with a threat analysis approach: it is demonstrated that
    cybercrime risks require organizations to move beyond audit and
    compliance. Moving beyond means understanding complex threat
    scenarios and study attacks in the wild with
    [cyber-intelligence](http://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx). Cases of
    publicly reported cybercrime attacks are used to outline the new
    threat landscape and the attack scenarios. The attacker motives and
    the means to achieve them will be analyzed by using [attack
    trees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_tree):an attack tree can
    be used to analyze cyber attacks against web applications, breaches
    of credit card data as well as ATM fraud. [Use and misuse
    cases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misuse_case) will be used to
    evaluate the strength of multi-factor authentication against attacks
    such as MiTM (Man In The Middle). Examples of [attack
    vectors](http://ha.ckers.org/xss.html) for testing defenses against
    cybercrime attacks (e.g. [HTML-IFRAME Injection Attack
    Vectors](http://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/frame-injection-fun/) and
    [drive by download](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive-by_download))
    will be provided. [Data Flow Diagrams
    (DFD)](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Application_Threat_Modeling)
    Analysis and [Architecture Risk Analysis
    examples](https://buildsecurityin.us-cert.gov/daisy/bsi/articles/best-practices/architecture.html)
    will be presented to identify the entry points for attack vectors,
    the user access levels that can be exploited and to enumerate
    threats, attacks, vulnerabilities and countermeasures. Security by
    deployment and security by design concepts will be elaborated as
    strategy to build countermeasures using [security by design
    architecture
    principles](http://blogs.msdn.com/jmeier/archive/2008/04/07/security-principles.aspx).
    Finally, risk mitigation strategies will be discussed as
    self-awareness questions. The presentation re-affirms that audit and
    compliance needs to be approached as factor of minimum business risk
    mitigation. A cybercrime risk mitigation strategy needs to
    consider[application threat
    modeling](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Application_Threat_Modeling)
    as critical assessment for high risk web applications.

    Security is a big issue and all too often it is only thought of as
    it applies to the network administrator. However, programmers face a
    host of threats to their applications. The solution is to build a
    threat model. The purpose of a threat model is to aid in identifying
    potential threats before a system is built, not after. This talk
    will cover some of the common threats to applications and how to
    prevent them. This talk is based upon [Microsoft's Threat Analysis
    and Modeling (TAM)
    tool](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/dd206731.aspx) and
    their newest version which is now part of their Security Development

    Input validation vulnerabilities in web applications can be
    exploited with attack vectors to cause business impacts such as
    information disclosure, data alteration and destruction, denial or
    degradation of service, financial loss fraud and reputation brand
    damage. Several web applications today have implemented filtering
    techniques to block such attack vectors; unfortunately such
    filtering techniques are seldom based on black lists that fail when
    attackers use filter evasion techniques such as single and double
    encoding. This presentation will cover the basic understanding of
    attack vectors, the malicious payloads that can be carried out and
    the techniques used by attackers to evade input validation filters.
    Lists of different variations of encoded XSS attack vectors and
    constructed SQL injection vectors will be presented. From the
    defensive perspective, these lists can be used as cheat sheets for
    testing the efficacy of the input filtering techniques. A
    demonstration of a sample implementation of effective input
    validation using J2EE struts framework is also presented. During the
    presentation, web application developers and architects will be
    introduced to the concepts of canonicalization, encoding and
    sanitization and guided on the most effective input validation
    strategies and techniques as well as on the best use of available

    well defined interfaces for doing security "right" within your
    application and provides a reference implementation of these
    interfaces. ESAPI handles difficult tasks such as validation,
    encoding, encryption, and more. This presentation will provide a
    guided tour of ESAPI capabilities and recommended usage to combat

    What is the best way to start a software security initiative within
    your organization? First you need to present the business case to
    the management in terms of costs, threats and root causes.
    Subsequently you need to provide a roadmap. The first step of the
    roadmap is to evaluate the maturity of secure software development
    processes, tools and training. The next step is to adopt a framework
    for software security activities, software development and risk
    management processes: software security enhanced process models such
    as MS SDL, OWASP CLASP and Cigital TP are examples of security
    engineering frameworks that can be used. Software security
    activities such as threat modeling, secure code reviews and security
    testing work as checkpoints to validate software artifacts and
    manage software security risks. Finally data such as vulnerability
    metrics and process management metrics helps to manage and optimize
    the software security processes in the long term and show the
    effectiveness of the software security initiative to the
    organization.

    Static analysis is the process of analyzing software for security
    vulnerabilities. Static analysis can be a costly and time consuming
    process, but is a link in the chain for producing secure software.
    Join us as we explorer building a business case for static analysis
    and review the current open source static analysis tools.

  - An Introduction to Web Proxies - <i>Blaine Wilson, Technology
    Information Security Officer,
    [Citigroup](http://www.citibank.com/us/index.htm)</i>

<!-- end list -->

    Web proxies will be explained and the group will be shown how to
    install and configure WebScarab. WebScarab operates as an
    intercepting proxy, allowing the operator to review and modify
    requests created by the browser before they are sent to the server,
    and to review and modify responses returned from the server before
    they are received by the browser. The presentation will include
    several examples of intercepting, reviewing and modifying HTTP
    requests and responses.

    Before to diagnose the disease and provide the cure a doctor looks
    at the root causes of the sickness, the risk factors and the
    symptoms. In case of application security the majority of the root
    causes of the security issues are in-secure software, the risk
    factors can be found in how bad the application is designed, the
    software is coded and the application is tested and the symptoms in
    how the application vulnerabilities are exposed. The presentation
    will articulate the problem of secure software, the costs, the
    software security risks and how these are typically dealt with by
    most organizations. Solving the problem of software security
    requires people, process and tools. From the information security
    perspective we will look at ways to enforcing software security by
    looking at risks that threat agents (attacks) can exploit
    vulnerabilities due to insecure software and the resulting impact on
    company assets. Implementing a set of software security requirements
    is the best place to start to address the root causes of web
    application vulnerabilities. With a categorization of web
    application vulnerabilities as weakness in application security
    controls, it is easier to describe the root cases as coding errors.
    A good place to start documenting software security requirements is
    the OWASP Top Ten, for each of these vulnerabilities we will discuss
    the threat, the risk factors, the software root causes of the
    vulnerability, how to find if you are vulnerable and if you are
    which countermeasures need to be implemented.
