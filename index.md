# About OWASP

The OWASP Foundation is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization incorporated
in the United States of America. OWASP's all-volunteer participants
produce free, professional quality, open-source documentation, tools,

## OWASP Membership

OWASP is an open source project dedicated to finding and fighting the
causes of insecure software. All of our materials are free and offered
under an open source license, so you do not have to become a member to
use them or participate in our projects, mailing lists, conferences,
meetings or other activities. On the other hand OWASP relies on membership
fees and sponsorship to support it's activities. There are also unique
benefits to become a corporate member such as the use of OWASP materials
within your organization without the restrictions associated with the
various open source licenses. OWASP individual members also get
discounts to security conferences and other perks. For more information
consult the [OWASP
Membership](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership) web page.
