## About OWASP

The OWASP Foundation is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization incorporated
in the United States of America. OWASP's all-volunteer participants
produce free, professional quality, open-source documentation, tools,
and standards. Consult the [how OWASP
works](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/How_OWASP_Works) web page for
more information about projects and governance.

## OWASP Membership

OWASP is an open source project dedicated to finding and fighting the causes of
insecure software. All of our materials are free and offered under an open
source license, so you do not have to become a member to use them or participate
in our projects, mailing lists, conferences, meetings or other activities. On
the other hand OWASP relies on membership fees and sponsorship to support it's
activities. There are also unique benefits to become a corporate member such as
the use of OWASP materials within your organization without the restrictions
associated with the various open source licenses. OWASP individual members also
get discounts to security conferences and other perks. For more information
consult the [OWASP Membership](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership) web
page.
